These are the anonymized, item-level results from the [Aperture OHBM community survey](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/aperture-ohbm-community-survey), distributed December 2018.
We have also published a [short blog post on these results]() on the OHBM blog.

For more information on the Aperture initiative, please see [the original announcement](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/announcing-aperture-the-ohbm-publishing-platform).

Here, we include the text from that blog post as well as all code necessary to reproduce the included figures.
