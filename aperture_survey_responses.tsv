There is a tremendous gap between releasing basic, functioning code in the interests of openness and transparency, and releasing a complete, convenient package which may be trivially installed and run by any reviewer (or other) who may or may not have access to (or sufficient direct experience with) any necessary, related components.    Question four is perhaps poorly worded, since it discusses options which are not broadly available today. I'd absolutely like to see tracked updates and linked code/data, even if it doesn't affect publishing decisions so much at this stage...

Nobody will pay for publishing or accessing at Aperture when they can deposit their data/paper/poster/code for free somewhere else.

Much as many academic committees involve people at different levels, gender, ethnic groups, and domain expertise, I would expect Aperture to support such diversity in every aspect, as practically feasible. For Aperture, it should also take into consideration geographic diversity.	The concept of Aperture is great. In many other areas of neuroscience, society journals have become revenue streams that have compelled the society to not move away from a pay model (Science, J Neuro, AIP, IEEE). Given this journal is being started in the 21st century, and we already have examples like Wikipedia/Wikidata, every effort should be made to make information as accessible as possible worldwide without as limited an APC as possible. Many institutions are setting up their own repositories, and it would be worthwhile for the OHBM society to partner with such institutions. In cases of public/accessible data (FCP-Indi, ABCD, UK Biobank and others), I would request that OHBM/Aperture work with these sources to track components of data that are used in Aperture publications. Aperture has a chance to redefine culture in the neuroimaging community without changing the quality of publications. At the same time, I would encourage that Aperture develop clear principles to indicate that the submissions are not just end points of research threads, but contribute to entities (results, code, data, tutorials, opinions) that can be reused by others. It should also provide a way to indicate what contributions are being made by authors: https://elifesciences.org/labs/b86daa1d/author-contributions-recognising-researchers-for-the-work-they-do . Let's use Aperture to move away from an archaic information filtering system to one that truly enables growth of knowledge.    I would be happy to provide additional details as necessary.

No paywall, but also no mandatory publishing fees. Instead, we mention the actual costs (like Wikipedia does) of publishing and tell readers (and authors) how much an article read/publication would cost. They can then decide freely what to give and what suits their usage. This way we neither block readers nor authors from low-income countries to educate themselves or others. And I do think that most institutions who have the money would support this or we can promote this model to the general public.	500	200	200	500	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	OHBM Council decision		OHBM community has a say		Make sure to include editors from low-income countries to have advocates against paywalls on either readers' or authors' side.    Make sure that reviews indeed become fair - the editors should be much more critical to unfair (misogynous, homophobic, (academic) age-discriminating) review(er)s. Publishing the reviews and linking them (even anonymously) to each other helps profiling bad reviewers, publishing editor notes puts more pressure on the editors to step in where necessary.	Great initiative. What is really needed, however, is to give academic credit to the additional load that implementing these concepts (e.g., code review) will put on reviewers, editors. There should be a c(community-) or o(pen science) index for each researcher that reflects her/his/.../ engagement for such publication models beyond being an author with many papers.

This survey approach is fundamentally flawed and as SCIENTISTS this should be understood.    This survey will likely be completed by those most interested in changing to a new open system and tearing down the current publication system.  The more militant the perspective the more likely they will be to complete this survey.    I'm sorry to say this but the results of this survey are obvious before a single person completes it.

A top-down approach to ensure the editorial positions are distributed across the community would be good, ensuring that gender, background, SES and disability status are properly represented.

This should not be a lucrative buisness as it is for book-shop editors (non scientific editors / books editors), since in the context of book edition, the authors are paid for their publications. Also it should not be allowded to make money on scientific and educational materials produced by public research.

Editorial boards should be required to have members from all career stages from post-doc upwards (under-represented groups get increasingly more under-represented the further up the ladder one goes).

Double blind reviews may help avoid biases.	I wonder how all these open code policies will affect diversity, since github and similar are very male dominated. If handled well, I imagine it can be good and educative, bringing more diversity to github. If handled badly, we may bias even more the publishing authors and reviewer pool.

I want to qualify my response to the issue of a publication specifically associated with and managed by OHBM:  If OHBM chose to create a publication for its membership, then it would need to be inclusive to standard empirical and review articles (which I had earlier indicated I did not favor as other publications fulfill this need).  If OHBM were to publish such a journal, then I would think it should both manage the publication and financially benefit from its growth.  In other words, I have two scenarios when this survey allows for only one.  I think the community as a whole would benefit from a NOVEL publication, one focused on data and code more than standard research articles and my responses reflect that preference.

Grants in some countries (like the US) include open access fees, but this is not true everywhere. Science is being decided by wealth over merit. Please offer an open access fee waiver option.

I am already overwhelmed by review request from OA journals (Frontiers and Scientific Reports), a completely free submission seems to lead to large submission number. More than any descent peer-review system can absorb.   A small submission fee would maybe prevent a few unnecessary submissions but alos provide some revenue, without the pressure of letting the manuscript go through to cash in the only publication fee.

I've looked at lots of code written by others and, in my experience, scientists write shitty code. Not to say that it doesn't do what was intended. More that it can be very difficult to decipher how it works. I would enforce public release of the code and let the community review it.
